Integrating client project

[!] From now on use `SampleApp.xcworkspace`.

Integrating Pod target `Pods-Reachability` into aggregate target Pods of project `SampleApp.xcodeproj`.

[!] Xcodeproj is using a fall back solution for parsing XML. To use a faster alternative install libxml:
`$ gem install libxml-ruby`

[!] The `:local` option of the Podfile has been renamed to `:path` and it is deprecated.

[!] The target `iOS App [Release]` overrides the `OTHER_CFLAGS` build setting defined in `Pods/Pods.xcconfig'.
    - Use the `$(inherited)` flag, or
    - Remove the build settings from the target.
